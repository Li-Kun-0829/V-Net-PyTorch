# V-Net-PyTorch
V-Net PyTorch program
1. this project is based on the work from Fausto Milletari, Nassir Navab and Seyed-Ahmad Ahmadi : <V-Net: Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation>
2. the source code which this paper provided is based on Caffe Framework
3. currently PyTorch Framework is popular, so re-write the code after learning the paper & Caffe code, and it can run on the PyTorch platform well
4. the training set and test set can be found in
   Litjens, G., Toth, R., van de Ven, W., Hoeks, C., Kerkstra, S., van Ginneken, B., Vincent, G., Guillard, G., Birbeck, N., Zhang, J., et al.: Evaluation of prostate segmentation algorithms for mri: the promise12 challenge. Medical image analysis 18(2), 359â€“373 (2014)
* in the program, the definition of 'train acc' is wrong, it means 'train acc' has no meaning, please ignore it.
